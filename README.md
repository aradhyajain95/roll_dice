The Game Of Dice.

Here, we have a Flutter Application that can simulate a game of Rolling Dice.

This is a 2 Player game where each player has to reach a WINNING SCORE. First player to reach the score wins the game.

Every time a player rolls a dice, the number of points are added to that persons score.
If rolled a 6, throw the dice again.
